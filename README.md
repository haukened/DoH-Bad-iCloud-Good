# DoH-Bad-iCloud-Good
DoH IP Blacklisting, but allows iCloud

## What is this?
This is a file i maintain for my personal home firewall. I Block DoH at home, but am also an iCloud user.  Many malicious apps will use DoH to circumvent DNS blocking, however since iCloud only allows this for paid users, i very much doubt that it falls into the threat category.  

## Why block DoH and not DoH from iCloud?
Cybersecurity is all about evaluating what threats you're trying to address, mine is malware, not content filtering.

## Can I use this?
Yes!  Though if you're an enterprise user, you may want to block iCloud. If so head on over to [DibDot DoH-IP-blocklists](https://github.com/dibdot/DoH-IP-blocklists) on GitHub for the full list including iCloud.

## You sound like a crazy person!
Yes.
